# Emotion-to-Environment Generator

## Overview

Emotion-to-Environment Generator is a creative Python project that transforms emotions into immersive environments. Users input an emotion, and the program generates a matching atmosphere using color palettes, ambient sound suggestions, and short descriptive text.

The goal is to explore how emotions shape perception and mood by translating internal feelings into external, imagined spaces.

## Features

* Accepts a single emotion or feeling as input
* Generates a mood-based color palette
* Suggests ambient sounds that fit the emotion
* Produces a short descriptive environment narrative
* Lightweight and easy to extend

## Why This Project Exists

Emotions are often abstract and difficult to explain. This project treats emotions as environments, making them easier to visualize and understand. It blends creativity, psychology, and programming into a small but expressive tool.

## Example Output

**Input:** anxiety

**Output:**

* Colors: muted blues, sharp whites, deep shadows
* Sounds: distant echoes, low static, slow breathing
* Description: A narrow room where the walls feel closer than they should, and every sound lingers longer than expected.

## Tech Stack

* Python 3
* Standard library only (no external dependencies)

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

```text
Enter an emotion: anxiety
```

The program outputs a color palette, ambient sound suggestions, and a short descriptive environment based on the emotion.

## Future Ideas

* Emotion intensity scaling
* Save generated environments to a file
* GUI or web-based version
* Procedural sound or visual generation

This project is open for learning, experimentation, and creative expansion.
